        <h2>For Pediatric Patients</h2>
        <p>
          Our VR programs for pediatric patients are carefully designed to create engaging, age-appropriate experiences that reduce stress and anxiety associated with hospital stays and medical procedures. By immersing children in calming and fun environments—such as exploring outer space, swimming with dolphins, or visiting interactive story worlds—we help divert their attention from discomfort and fear. These experiences support emotional regulation, improve cooperation during treatments, and encourage positive coping strategies. All sessions are facilitated by trained specialists who ensure safety and monitor patient responses in real time.

        <h2>For Rehabilitation Patients</h2>
        <p>
          Virtual Voyages VR offers tailored rehabilitation programs aimed at enhancing physical, cognitive, and emotional recovery. Our interactive VR exercises promote improved range of motion, balance, and coordination, while cognitive tasks support memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. The immersive nature of VR motivates patients to actively participate in their therapy, increasing adherence and engagement. Programs are personalized based on each patient’s therapy goals and limitations, with built-in safety measures and facilitator guidance to ensure optimal outcomes and prevent fatigue or injury.
